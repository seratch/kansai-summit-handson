## Skinny application

Run Skinny app now!

    ./skinny run

Let's try scaffolding. Simple Bootstrap based CRUD pages will be generated.

    ./skinny g scaffold members member name:String activated:Boolean luckyNumber:Option[Long] birthday:Option[LocalDate]
    ./skinny db:migrate
    ./skinny run

Testing is also important. Running tests is like this:

    ./skinny db:migrate test
    ./skinny test

Skinny apps are Servlet applications. Let's create war file and deploy it to Servlet containers you prefer (e.g. Jetty, Tomcat, etc.).

   ./skinny package
